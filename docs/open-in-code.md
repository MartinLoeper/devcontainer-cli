# devcontainer open-in-code

The `devcontainer open-in-code` command opens the current folder in VS Code as a dev container, i.e. it skips the normal step of opening in VS Code and then clicking # on the "Re-open in container" prompt to reload the window as a dev container. With `devcontainer open-in-code` you get straight to the dev container!

You can also use `devcontainer open-in-code <path>` to open a different folder as a devcontainer. 

If you want to use the VS Code Insiders release, you can use `devcontainer open-in-code-insiders`.
